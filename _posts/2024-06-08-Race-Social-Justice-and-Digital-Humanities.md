Course Description:
The goal of this course was to adequately address how to integrate race and social justice topics into the study of digital humanities. We accomplished this mission through the topics of Games, Mapping, Digital Pedagogy, Digital Ethics and Multimodality, and Digital Archiving. On this website, I will illustrate what we learned about each topic and how one could apply what they learned to a humanities research project.
