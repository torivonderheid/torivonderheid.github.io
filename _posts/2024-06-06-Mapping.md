In the Mapping unit, we discussed industry-standard mapping programs such as Esri and StoryMaps and their pros and cons. Also, we learned about countermapping initiatives and how they can represent previously ignored perspectives.


To begin, Esri is a mapping software that was developed by the US Military and is now available to the public. This software can illustrate both the geology and geography of an area. Although Esri is the main program used for this type of mapping, it has many drawbacks, as its user function still has a "kill" button. StoryMaps is very similar to Esri, but its main difference is the ability to add a piece of writing or a "story" to one's map. Both programs utilize a "birds eye view" to display their maps. An issue with this type of view is that it reinforces this kind of Godly perspective and does not allow for the viewer to read the map in a different way. 


Countermapping was born from this problem, as the traditional way in which maps have been created and read is not the only correct version. In class, we looked at this "upside down" map of India.

Creating countermaps contributes to the study of mapping and adds a new perspective to the cultures represented by the map.
