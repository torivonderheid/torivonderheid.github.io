On May 31, 2024, a few days before the Digital Humanities Summer Institute began, another participant and I flew to Victoria to sightsee. During our whale watching tour we witnessed tail flips from multiple humback whales, of which I have included pictures.

After our 3 hour boat ride, we hopped on a double-decker bus that drove us to the Butchart Gardens. Previously a limestone quarry, the area housed multiple different themed gardens, including the Sunken Gardens and the Japanese Gardens.

I highly recommend this tour for any future participants, as both the whale watching and the Butchart Gardens tours gave me context that was very helpful for understanding topics regarding the history of Victoria and Canada in my course.
