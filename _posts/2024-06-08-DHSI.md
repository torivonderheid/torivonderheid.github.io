On May 31, 2024, a few days before the Digital Humanities Summer Institute began, another participant and I flew to Victoria to sightsee. During our whale watching tour we witnessed tail flips from multiple humback whales, of which I have included pictures.

After our 3 hour boat ride, we hopped on a double-decker bus that drove us to the Butchart Gardens.
